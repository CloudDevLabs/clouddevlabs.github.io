					<h4>Technology + Process + Culture</h4>

					<p>CloudDevLabs provides holistic software development services. And what it means is that
						we don't just take requirements from our clients and deliver code to customer's source
						repository for sign-off. CloudDevLabs services go far further than that:<br>
						●&nbsp;Understand client's goals and evolve requirements with them, breaking the silos
							and potential miscommunication issues between business and engineering<br>
						●&nbsp;Follow the process that allows transparency and control, at the same time
							empowerment and freedom of engineering innovation<br>
						●&nbsp;Make the agile process work best for your specific team and product
							as it's evolutionary and is meant improve itself over time<br>
						●&nbsp;Use the most important advantages of the agile process to deliver software
						 	to the client as soon as possible allowing for early feedback and course correction<br>
						●&nbsp;Use technology and architecture that is competitive in the 21st century,
							cloud-native, built for scalability<br>
						●&nbsp;Focus on quality with tools and techniques, such as continuous integration,
							automated unit testing, pair programming, test-driven development, design patterns,
							behavior-driven development, domain-driven design, code refactoring, and other techniques
							are often used to improve quality and enhance product development agility.

					<p>Essentially what it becomes is building future-proof software that is ready for the 21st

					<h4>Future-proof, cloud-native, scalable, efficient</h4>

						The way the software solutions are built in terms of design, the way, the
						integral parts of the system communicate with each other, what technologies
						are chosen for persistence, communication, messaging, all of that
						plays crucial role for the application to be useful, efficient, and
						serve your business for a long time. Even more so when it comes to
						high-load systems and/or complex systems. And especially in the time
						when the demands of the time to be competitive in the business calls
						for using the cloud.
					</p>

					<p>
						We provide software architecture consulting to eliminate bottlenecks and
						enable system scalability. We choose tools and platforms that are the most
						suitable for your purposes. As a result, your IT spending drops and your
						revenue rises.

					<h4>Go fast, be adaptive, forever</h4>

					<p>
						Software Development Process is essential in organizing any software
						development work even if it's a team of one person and pet project.
						The methodology chosen in by any particular organization or project
						depends on many factors but when chosen correctly it makes software
						development faster, communication more efficient, product safer,
						tested and properly working at any time. But even more important,
						the process allows you to gain in productivity and efficiency and
						also be sustainable over an extended period of time!
					</p>

					<p>
						Modern software development world is in much preference of choosing
						Agile Process over the older much more prescriptive methodologies like
						Waterfall, Spiral and other.
					</p>

					<p>
						Agile software development is an approach to software development under
						which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort
						of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their users. It advocates
						adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual
						improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.
					</p>

					<div class="pull-left col-md-6 hack-no-padding">
<!--
						<p>
							Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:<br>
							●&nbsp;Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.<br>
							●&nbsp;Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.<br>
							●&nbsp;Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)<br>
							●&nbsp;Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers<br>
							●&nbsp;Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted<br>
							●&nbsp;Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)<br>
							●&nbsp;Working software is the primary measure of progress<br>
							●&nbsp;Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace<br>
							●&nbsp;Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design<br>
							●&nbsp;Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential<br>
							●&nbsp;Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams<br>
							●&nbsp;Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly<br>

						<p>
							Using our extended experience and battle-tested experts, CloudDevLabs provides
							remote or on-site support in agile processes to help companies launch,
							scale or improve their Agile software process implementation. We look
							to engage in high-level discussion about how Agile methods can improve
