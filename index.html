			<h4 class="align-left">Go fast, be adaptive, forever</h4>

			<p>
				Software Development Process is essential in organizing any software
				development work even if it's a team of one person and pet project.
				The methodology chosen in by any particular organization or project
				depends on many factors but when chosen correctly it makes software
				development faster, communication more efficient, product safer,
				tested and properly working at any time. But even more important,
				the process allows you to gain in productivity and efficiency and
				also be sustainable over an extended period of time!
			</p>

			<p>
				Modern software development world is in much preference of choosing
				Agile Process over the older much more prescriptive methodologies like
				Waterfall, Spiral and other.
			</p>

			<p>
				Agile software development is an approach to software development under
				which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort
				of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their users. It advocates
				adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual
				improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

							In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service:

							is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps.<br>
							<br>
							The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps written in

							Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is

							●&nbsp;Loosely coupled<br>
							●&nbsp;Independently deployable<br>
							●&nbsp;Organized around business capabilities<br>

						<h5>Remote & co-located teams</h5>
						<p class="url">https://martinfowler.com</p>
						<p class="little">
							There isn't a simple dichotomy of remote versus co-located work,

							suitable for them. While it's impossible to determine conclusive
							evidence, my sense is that most groups are more productive working
							in a co-located manner. <br>
							<br>
							But you can build a more productive team
							by using a distributed working model, because it gives you
							access to a wider talent pool.
